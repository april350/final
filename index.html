    <h1>A Conversation about Gentrification</h1>
    <h2>By [Jena Sandi]</h2>
    <p>The economy is at an all-time high in certain sectors; unemployment is down, wages are finally creeping up and there is a supposed revitalization occurring in urban America. But who is this boom helping? As the saying goes, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. There is a crisis going on in America the poor are becoming houseless at an alarming rate. The wages so called unskilled workers earn are not enough to afford a 2 bedroom in any American county. In NYC, the $15/hr. minimum wage that was recently implemented is not nearly enough to afford a studio apartment. As for the government programs that should be finding solutions, they are a part of the problem. In my quest to bring to light this issue and the dramatic effects it can have on one’s life, I set out to speak to a native New Yorker to see how the housing crisis is affecting her.</p>
